- After adding TX queues now handling control-c and cancelable commands don't work
- Using the mem command without specifying a device file causes a crash
- Looks like there might be a bug in I2C HW periphral that doesn't accept short writes!
  I noticed it when examining MicroPython's code. There is a comment in matchine_i2c.c file that reads:
  "// Workaround issue with hardware I2C not accepting short writes." They use bitbanging/SW-I2C for short
  writes. I might have to do the same here too :(
